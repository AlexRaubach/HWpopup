## Getting Started


###Required Software

First you’ll need a Java IDE. We suggest [IntelliJ by Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)but there are a bunch of alternatives, use whatever you’re comfortable with.

You’ll also need the latest version of the [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
Be sure to get the one that says JDK

To add the JDK to IntelliJ, open it, go to File>Other Settings>Default Project Structure and below Project SDK hit new>JDK and navigate to the folder where you installed the JDK. Something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_111


###Github Setup and Downloading the Project


Create or log into your Github account, visit [the project's page](https://github.com/Mu0n/XWVassal) and click the fork button in the top right corner. 

Now that you have your own copy of the project, you need to clone it to your machine. If you're using IntelliJ you can follow [these directions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html). 

You'll want to add [Muon's repo](https://github.com/Mu0n/XWVassal) as an upstream repository so that it'll be easy to keep your version of the project up to date. 


to create a local copy of the current master branch named your_new_branch_name that can easily be merged with a pull request.
Push it to your own repo with git push origin your_new_branch_name and create a pull request via the github website.
