	  <p>That's it. Really. That's the only mandatory file. It contains a few 3x3 starfield maps (classic, light and deep), a teal nebula map (formerly known as blue nebula) and then a bunch of standard black maps (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 3x6 and 6x3). It contains all ships, pilots, upgrades, tokens, dials currently released in its counterpart tabletop game, and then some, as previews from FFG filter out information to us. Vassal is a great way to try out some of the unreleased, but spoiled stuff from the game.
	  <p>If you want more variety for the maps, there will be a new unified map pack carrying its own version number: Universal_Map_Pack_1.0.vmdx

They will be placed in a subfolder at the location of the main module file, (following the example) in \My Documents\Vassal\[--the module name followed by _ext--]\ when they are properly installed.

      The first step is to remember where you put the module files. If you forgot, there's an easy way. Open up Vassal's launcher window, and do a mouse-over on the module file. A blue popup field will appear and show you the location of the module file, like so:
	  <p><img src="./img/directory.png">
	  <p>
	  The second step is to simply delete the old .vmod file, which has this appearance:
	  <p><img src="./img/moduleIcon.png">
	  <p>The third step is to download the new file (from the page whose link is under "How to install the x-wing vassal modules for the first time") in that same location.
	  <p>
	  The fourth step is to go into the vassal launcher window, go to File/Open Module...
	  <p><img src="./img/openModule.png">
	  <p>Vassal will then attempt to launch the module - close those new windows and go back to the launcher.

      Someone named Aiden, who happened to post on afewmaneuvers back in 2012. Since then, the module has seen some sporadic work from Buhallin in 2013 to add some needed features (ship moves with right click menu). The modules are now maintained by Mu0n since August/September of 2013 (wave 3, firing arc corrections, length corrections, imperial aces, wave 4, transport, corvette, etc.), with help from theorist, chris B. for art, sigzog for helper ref cards, radarman5 for ship art, gabriel for map packs and silentubiquity for map packs + ship pictures + squad logfiles + side table logfile.

    <div id="organize" class="content">
	  This is purely a suggestion, but it will avoid some pitfalls new players routinely go into.
	  <p>First, make sure you zoom the map window to "Fit to Height". This will allow you to check out the side table at the right of the map, if needed. Some players put tokens and templates there and it's useful to keep an access to them.
	  <p><img src="./img/fitToHeight.png">
	  <p>Second, it's important to free up the neutral area (the map) as much as possible, so try to keep your pilot, upgrade and various chits inside your assigned player window. This is the full list of the windows I recommend keeping open, in a full screen 1920x1080 screenshot:
	  <p><img src="./img/layout.png">
	  <ul>
	  <li>Main Module window</li>
	  <li>Contested Sector (map window), zoomed: fit to height</li>

As an example, we want to create a XXBB list, so we go to Rebel/X-Wings and click on Red Squadron Pilot, then drag and drop it into the map window, or directly into your player hand window. Do it twice. Next, we go to Rebel/B-Wings, then drag and drop 2 copies of the Dagger Squadron Pilot. Last, we go to Upgrades/System and drag and drop 2 copies of Advanced Sensors and put them near the Dagger Squadron Pilot Cards. You now have a solid 100 point rebel list.

	  <p>Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to do this much faster.
	  <ul>
	  <li>Alt-<b>P</b> to increase pilot skill; Ctrl-Alt-<b>P</b> to decrease pilot skill</li>
	  <li>Alt-<b>A</b> to increase attack rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>A</b> to decrease attack rating</li>
	  <li>Alt-<b>D</b> to increase defense rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>D</b> to decrease defense rating</li>
	  <li>Alt-<b>H</b> to increase hull rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>H</b> to decrease hull rating</li>
	  <li>Alt-<b>S</b> to increase shield rating; Ctrl-Alt-<b>S</b> to decrease shield rating</li>
	  <li>Shift-<b>N</b> to add a ship name visible on the token at the top left</li>
	  <li>Shift-<b>P</b> to add a second/alternate ship name visible on the token at the bottom, much smaller</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p><b>Important:</b> you can always clone a ship by clicking on it (left mouse button), hitting Ctrl-C, then dragging the copy away from the original. This saves time when you have multiples of a ship type in a squad.

    <a href="#dials">What's the proper way to use the dials under vassal? (planning and activation phase)</a>
    <div id="dials" class="content">
	  First, you should name your dials so that there's no mixup during play. Do this by clicking on a dial, then Shift-N to edit its name tag. There's a second, small name tag that you can edit with Shift-P. In this example, I used the first one and kept the second one empty:
	  <p><img src="./img/dialRevealed.png">
	  <p>The proper way to use the dials during the planning and activation phases of the game is the following:
	  <p><ul>
	  <li>Changing the maneuvers of a dial while it's in the map window will trigger an anti-cheating warning message in the main window, therefore...</li>
	  <li>(planning phase) ...you have to change your dials inside your personal player hand window</li>
	  <li>Make sure the dial is hidden with Ctrl-R. This is what your own dial will look like while hidden. A ship icon appears in the top left corner <img src="./img/dialHiddenView1.png"></li>
	  <li>This is what your hidden dial will look like to your opponent: <img src="./img/dialHiddenView2.png"></li>
	  <li>Use '.' and ',' to cycle through the available moves.</li>
	  <li>When ready, bring your dials (still hidden) on the map window, besides your ships and declare you're ready in the chat window. Most players use the word "set". <img src="./img/set.png"></li>
	  <li>(activation phase) Respecting play order with regard to ascending pilot skill activation, reveal a dial with the same shortcut, Ctrl-R and activate your ship (see next item).
	  </ul>
	  <p>Some players enjoy rotating the dials, as it gives you an easier time to visualize the proper direction for turning ships when they're facing downward, for example. Do this by clicking on the dial and hitting the left or right arrow keys.

      Click on a ship and hit Shift-S to increase the stress by 1 with a small icon at the side of your ship and it can go up to 4. To decrease the stress count, hit Ctrl-Shift-S. To remove all stress at once, hit Ctrl-Shift-Alt-S. For other ship status condition tokens, check the right click menu, or go find the shortcuts in the "How To & Shortcuts" button, under the "Ship Stats and Status" section, "Small & Large Ships" item.
<p>Another way to spawn bigger tokens that are manageable by way of drag and dropping, you can go to the Pieces Window, under the Chits tab.</p>

    <a href="#action">How do I declare what actions my ships do? (activation phase)</a>
    <div id="action" class="content">
      There are two ways to do this:
	  <p>Way #1: more tedious, but more intuitive. Spawn enough tokens from the "Pieces" window under "Chits/Tokens". This is tedious because you'll have to manually put tokens during the activation phase, then take out every unused focus and evade tokens during the end phase. There is a faster way.
	  <p>Way #2: (<b>heartily recommended</b>) Ships have space for 3 "action declarations". As always, you have access to this in their right click contextual menus, but here are the shortcuts:
	  <ul>
	  <li>Shift-A to cycle through the first line of potential ship actions.</li>
	  <li>Ctrl-A to cycle through the first line of potential ship actions.</li>
	  <li>Shift-Ctrl-A to cycle through the third line of potential ship actions.</li>
	  </ul>
	  As an example, Darth Vader (in a TIE Advanced x1) with push the limit can easily go up to 3 actions during a turn and would use all three 'lines'.

    <a href="#barrel">How do I perform a barrel roll? (activation phase)</a>
    <div id="barrel" class="content">
      There is a way to automate the extremeties of the barrel roll actions you can do. As an example, you could barrel roll on a side as forward as possible, or as backward as possible. Other non-extreme rolls are also legal, as long as you don't go beyond those extremes. The extremes are automated because they are quite popular choices. Here are the shortcuts for them:
      <ul>
	  <li>BR left as forward as possible: CTRL-8</li>
	  <li>BR left as backward as possible: CTRL-SHIFT-8</li>
	  <li>BR right as forward as possible: ALT-8</li>
          <li>BR right as backward as possible: ALT-SHIFT-8</li>
	  </ul>
      If you want to perform a non-extreme barrel roll, fortunately, there's now a way to semi-automate it (since v5.3.0). You can place the barrel roll template midway on the side of your ship using:

    <a href="#undock">How do I undock a ship (Gozanti, Ghost, YV-666)? (activation or combat phase)</a>
    <div id="undock" class="content">
	<strong>STEP 1:</strong> Check the carrier ship's current bearing with ALT-B (it can be heavily modified during a game due to turns, banks and funky collisions):
	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock1.png" alt="" /></p>

	The chat window will report its value (1 = facing up, 91 = facing right, etc)

	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock2.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 2:</strong> Put the undocking ship on the map, close by:
	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock3.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 3:</strong> Adjust the undocking ship's bearing so that it matches the carrier ship. Use Left or Right arrow to make big 15 degree rotations; use CTRL-Left Arrow or CTRL-Right Arrow to make small 1 degree rotations. Use ALT-B on this undocking ship to check your bearing value. When both ships show the same bearing, all is good.

	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock4.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 4:</strong> If your ship has to undock through the rear of the carrier ship, you will need to U-turn it in place. There's a shortcut for that that's been added for a fairly good amount of module releases now, it's CTRL-U:

	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock5.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 5:</strong> The next few steps are best done at 100% zoom, assuming the undocking ship is close enough to the carrier ship. We need precision, hence 100% zoom. First, copy the undocking ship in place using CTRL-C:

	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock6.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 6:</strong> Perform the maneuver you want for your undocking ship (the example here shows a hard left 2) and hit 'C' to pop a maneuver template, as you would during collision management. BONUS MANAGEMENT: if the undocking ship DOES collide, you'll be in a great position to deal with it in a few moments! You should see that the copy has moved, the original ship is still in place and a maneuver guide exists between both copies of the ship:

	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock7.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 7:</strong> Grab select the 2 copies of the ship and the template (draw a rectangle around those 3 objects to highlight them - if you're successful, a yellow border will encircle them all). Alternatively, hold shift and left click all 3 of those objects.

	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock8.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 8:</strong> Move those 3 objects so that the original position of the undocking ship is aligned with your carrier ship. Make fine adjustments of its position with Shift-Arrows to get pixel perfect. The nubs of the undocking ship have to coincide with the nubs of the carrier ship.
	<p><img src="http://s93768914.onlinehome.us/xwing/img/undock9.png" alt="" /></p>

	<strong>STEP 9:</strong> Delete the unwanted stuff. Congrats, you're done!

    <a href="#damage">How do you keep track of damage? (combat phase)</a>
    <div id="damage" class="content">
      Most players keep track of it on the map itself, directly on the ships. You can adjust the relevant ship stats using these shortcuts:
	  <p><ul>
	  <li>Decrease shield value: Ctrl-Alt-S</li>
	  <li>Decrease Hull value: Ctrl-Alt-H</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>When you take damage to the hull (past shields), the game expects you to draw damage cards. Each player can spawn their own damage deck to their player window, then drag and drop cards from it, to their respective player hands as damage accumulates on the ship. This is on top of modifying the ship values on the ship pieces on the map.
	  <p>As for critical damage, it is customary to draw the appropriate card on the map, flip it (Ctrl-F) there and wait for some acknowledgement from your opponent. On the map, every player can then mouse-hover the card and see a zoomed version of it, allowing to read it easily. If you spawn and flip the card in your player hand window instead, only you can benefit from the mouse-hover zoom.
