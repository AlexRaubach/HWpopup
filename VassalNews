The latest 7.0.7 X-Wing module has been released: patch notes are here - https://teamcovenant.com/star-wars-x-wing/x-wing-module-7-0-7-available-auzituck-move-bug-fix
IMPORTANT, if you encounter a bug while trying to move a ship, it needs the following:
-A player with 7.0.5 moves a ship
-His opponent uses a version BEFORE 7.0.5 and has spawned a few rocks on the map
To resolve: both players need 7.0.7
